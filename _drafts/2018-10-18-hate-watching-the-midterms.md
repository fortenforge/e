On the evening of November 6th, I'll be watching the results come in for the 2018 midterm elections. You should too. There are many ways to experience the event: maybe you want to watch Wolf Blitzer [repeatedly state the obvious ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Xe2Ep93dA) on CNN. Maybe you want to incessantly refresh Nate Silver's twitter feed. Maybe you want to spend all night with your eyes glued to a [jittering needle](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/2018-midterms-forecasts-538-cnn-times-needle.php/).

There are 435 House seats, 34 Senate seats, 36 Governor's offices, 1 Mississippi [special election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/mississippi-special/), thousands of state legislative seats, and hundreds of ballot initiatives up for grabs. The midterms can be a little overwhelming.

I think it's helpful to pick a handful of races that you're interested in for one reason or another, and follow these obsessively all night. Here, I've described 10 races that I plan to watch. They were chosen not because of their political importance or their competitiveness, but because each represents a chance to deny elected office to a truly awful human being.

## 1. Chris Collins ([NY-27](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/new-york/27/))

In August, Chris Collins was arrested by the FBI on charges of insider trading. The details of the case are [scammy and gross](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-09/chris-collins-insider-trading-arrest-is-a-huge-throwback) and they're made all the more hilarious because Collins was supposedly at the White House while he was insider trading. Collins then tried to drop out of the race so that GOP officials could appoint a less toxic candidate, but New York makes it surprisingly hard to get off the ballot, so he had to [reverse course](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/407005-indicted-gop-lawmaker-to-stay-on-ballot-in-new-york-this-fall-report) for fear of splitting the ticket.

Collins is up against [Nate McMurray](https://votemcmurray.com/), a Fulbright Scholar.

## 2. Duncan Hunter ([CA-50](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/california/50/))

Chris Collins was the second GOP congressman to endorse Donald Trump. Duncan Hunter was the first. The two men have a lot in common. For example, he was also [indicted by the FBI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/congressman-duncan-hunter-wife-charged-with-spending-campaign-money-on-personal-expenses/2018/08/21/4dba040a-a591-11e8-a656-943eefab5daf_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.dd1f47161b2a) this past August. He was accused of misusing campaign to buy a plane ticket for his pet rabbit (among other things). When confronted over this, he tried [blaming his wife](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rep-duncan-hunter-blames-wife-for-campaign-spending_us_5b7f7dabe4b07295151179f2?h_sid=90058a7445-5a4d81ea87649b860406ba96).

Incidentally, Hunter has been running a markedly racist campaign, implying that his opponent, [Ammar Campa-Najjar](https://www.campacampaign.com/meet-ammar) is a ["national security risk"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/duncan-hunters-campaign-ramps-up-attacks-that-falsely-claim-opponent-is-a-national-security-risk/2018/10/18/51a2f32e-d0bb-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.296888410508). Campa-Najjar (who is a Christian, for what it's worth) held a security clearance for his work for the government between 2013 and 2017; Hunter, as an indicted criminal, would be unable to obtain one.

## 3. Greg Gianforte ([MT-AL](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/montana/1/))

You might have heard about Gianforte this past May when he [body-slammed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/24/greg-gianforte-bodyslams-reporter-ben-jacobs-montana) [Ben Jacobs](https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/867517225820966912), a reporter from *The Guardian*, a couple days prior to the Montanan special election. Disturbingly, Gianforte managed to win that election and he may very well win on November 6th as well.

By the way, here was Duncan Hunter's statement about the body-slamming incident: "It's not appropriate behavior. Unless the reporter deserved it."

Gianforte is also a Young-Earth creationist, and he and his family donated $290,000 to the [Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum](https://www.creationtruth.org/) which promotes the belief that humans and dinosaurs coexisted and that dinosaurs were on Noah's Ark.

Gianforte is up against [Kathleen Williams](https://kathleenformontana.com/).

## 4. Dana Rohrabacher ([CA-48](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/california/48/))

Dana Rohrabacher is [commonly called](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/putin-congress-rohrabacher-trump-231775) "Putin's favorite congressman." This reputation was well-earned. The FBI [warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/us/politics/dana-rohrabacher-russia-spies.html) Rohrabacher in 2012 that Russian agents were attempting to recruit him. More recently, the congressman claimed that he [didn't believe](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/dana-rohrabacher-julian-assange-russian-hack/) the Russians hacked the DNC. In 2016, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy joked: "[t]here's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump."

The congressman is also one of several politicians on this list who claims to support protections for pre-existing conditions despite having made every effort to repeal Obamacare while in elected office.

Rohrabacher faces [Harley Rouda](https://www.harleyforcongress.com) this November.

## 5. Devin Nunes ([CA-22](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/california/22/))

In the 115th Congress, Devin Nunes's [primary role](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/magazine/how-devin-nunes-turned-the-house-intelligence-committee-inside-out.html) has been to play defense for Trump. He headed the short-lived and highly-partisan House congressional investigation into ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, which not only concluded that there was no collusion between the two, but also that Russia never sought the election of Trump, in direct contradiction to the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community.

Nunes's opponent is Democratic candidate [Andrew Janz](https://www.andrewjanzforcongress.com/).

## 6. Steve King ([IA-04](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/iowa/4/))

Steve King is a white supremacist. Steve King's Wikpedia page contains one full top-level section named ["Racist comments, controversies and far-right politics"](Racist comments, controversies and far-right politics). Steve King King compared the torture and prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to "hazing". In reference to earlier controversial comments he made, King said "with the inter-marriage, I'd like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same".

Steve King keeps a small Confederate flag on his desk. This is despite the fact that Iowa was a Union state. ["Steve King endorses a bona fide white supremacist for Toronto mayor"](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/18/17990718/steve-king-faith-goldy-white-supremacist-canada-iowa-republicans) is a headline that is true. ["What, Congressman Steve King Asks, Have Nonwhites Done for Civilization?"](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/us/politics/steve-king-nonwhite-subgroups.html) is another headline that is also true.

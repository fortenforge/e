On a particular evening during CPW 2014, several high-schoolers—some of whom knew each other, some of whom didn't—all converged on Simmons Hall to participate in a puzzlehunt.

In previous years we'd hunted with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈, floor-pi's mystery hunt team, but given their ever-increasing team size, and a strange warning that this year's hunt would have fewer puzzles, we decided to strike out on our own for 2018.

The weather, mercurial in a way that a Californian will never fully grasp, had turned to 20 degrees, and the Porter room, which was somehow sweltering the previous day, was now frigid.

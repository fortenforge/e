<!-- On a particular evening in the spring of 2014, several high-schoolers (some of whom knew each other) attending MIT's Campus Preview Weekend all converged at Simmons Hall to participate in a puzzlehunt. A subset of them enjoyed the experience enough that, come September -->


## The Hunt

I was nervous going into kickoff for a number of reasons. The organizers had made a strange announcement back in October stating that this hunt would have fewer puzzles than usual. This hunt was also special to me because it was almost certainly the last hunt I take part in while living in Cambridge.

## My Experience

Some people on our team expressed interest in getting an early lunch at [Flour](https://flourbakery.com/) before kickoff started. I suggested that we meet in the lesser-trafficked Flour behind Simmons to ensure we had enough space. A friend and I arrived a little early, so we grabbed a couple seats and waited for more people to arrive. I initially thought that just a handful of people would show up, but over the course of the next thirty minutes, a good 70% of our team eventually ended up in that Flour. We did quick introductions, everyone ordered food, and we mostly spent time reconnecting and talking about old hunts.

About a quarter to noon, we all walked over to Kresge and claimed a couple rows of seats. As we were sitting, more and more teammates joined us, and my hype level was dialed way up.


# Notes

* Weather??
* Remove solvers <3
* Runaround!!
* That unlocking structure
* It's easy to like a hunt if you managed to finish it
* pint glass


# Timeline
* Anticipation
  - Created guide to puzzlehunting in Google Sheets, glossary of puzzle hunt terms, our discord server, and google sheets infrastructure
  - Discord server had a bot that would call in new puzzles and a channel for blah
  - You can react to things which is nice.
  - Next year invest effort to have someone write a quick script which polls the website for changes and creates new puzzles based on that
  - Refreshing isithuntyet.info
* The morning before
  - Flour bakery
  - Kickoff! That amazing skit
  - Reflections on the theme
  - Walked back to BC, running around dealing with last minute concerns
  - Bingo sheet?
* Hunt starts
  - Solved first puzzle (!)
  - Namedrop a couple puzzles (whose entire premise is based on a funny joke about country songs)
  - Everytime we solved a meta, someone would come by and drop off an object
  - Fantastic runaround. it was pouring. started in secret ninja courtyard and wove in and out of MIT, hitting
* The islands
  - Picking which island to unlock
  - Everything got much much harder
  - slowly our solving rate started dropping way, way down
  - it was at this point that i started reevaluating the question of whether we'd actually finish. we knew all islands had to be approximately symmetric in length and difficulty, and the prospect of needing to to finish up all four of them seemed daunting, especially at the rate that we were accumulating brainpower
  - This is where the unlocking structure started to show some of it's problems. the width was very narrow, so it was easy for things to grind to a halt pretty fast. and at the rate we were accumulating buzzy bucks we were far from getting hints
* Went to sleep and woke up the next day
  - Missed an event :////
  - Called in COLOR MICROGRAPHY, which unlocked a new island!
  - Figured out how to fill in the grid of Star Wars meta, showed it to Herman, he thought about it and was like "F=ma". looked for all the MA's and then solved it
  - Star Trek meta fell over the course of the day. continued making progress on puzzles
  - By now the weather, mercurial in a way that a Californian will never fully grasp, had turned to 20 degrees, and the Porter room, which was somehow sweltering the previous day, was now frigid.
* It's kind of amusing being on a team with a couple strong remote solvers. You'll be sitting there staring at a spreadsheet wallowing in your stuckness, and then you'll check the call-in queue and then see that some puzzle has been solved?! Everyone will then ask each other who submitted it, no one will claim credit, and eventually

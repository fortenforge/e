*This is the last of three posts about the 2020 MIT Mystery Hunt. You can see the hunt website with all the puzzles and solutions [here](http://pennypark.fun), and read [my first post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-01-25-mystery-hunt-2020-part-1 %}) about the hunt theme and my experience.*

Here's a list of my favorite puzzles from this hunt:

## Individual Puzzles

**[Send Yourself Swanlumps](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/send_yourself_swanlumps.html):** This was a physical puzzle that took the form of a choose-your-own adventure book parodying the [*Give Yourself Goosebumps*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Yourself_Goosebumps) series. The puzzle had at least three layers embedded within the book, the most interesting of which involved solving a bunch of aptly-named [Split Decisions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/crosswords/variety-split-decisions.html) mini-puzzles. You can find a pdf of the book on the website, but I think it was a ton of fun to jump from page to page with the physical copy we were given.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at a small startup.
The views expressed here are personal opinions, and do not necessarily reflect
the opinions of my employer.

I have two main hobbies: [capture the flag competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) and [puzzlehunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzlehunt). Together, these cover something like 90% of the posts I write on this blog.

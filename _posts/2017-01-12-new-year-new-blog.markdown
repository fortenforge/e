As this site's about page already states:

>This site is my personal blog, where I hope to talk about completed puzzlehunts, CTFs, and personal projects or explorations.

Why? 3 reasons:

1. I do a lot of puzzlehunts and other competitions, and I want to have a better record of what went on in each of them so I can remember them 10 years on.
2. Blogging about these events forces me to reflect on them more, which hopefully will lead to long-term improvement.
3. Telling other people about the stuff you're passionate about is fun.


Anyways, we'll see what happens.

These are a few of my favorite things.

## Podcast episode: "Monetary Mysteries Revealed" from *The Weeds*

Karl Smith, a columnist at Bloomberg, is interviewed by Matt Yglesias, a journalist at Vox, about the federal reserve,
monetary policy, and the myth of the "skills gap." The interview was largely inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/karlbykarlsmith/status/1130154612537925633) which I swear you'll find clever once you listen to the episode. The position argued by Smith is that the Fed made a serious error in misjudging how low the unemployment rate could drop and tamping down on quantitative easing out of a misguided fear of inflation.

## Podcast miniseries: *Mitch* from *Embedded*

It's hard for me to convey how much I hate Mitch McConnell. You can draw a straight line between our current politcal dysfunction and some action he took while he was Senate minority or majority leader. This miniseries from *Embedded* explores his political career and somehow managed to make me hate him even more. It's great.

## Twitter accounts: @ne0liberal and @MikeGravel

The [Neoliberal Project](https://neoliberalproject.org/) is an effort to reclaim the word "neoliberal" mostly via [viral tweeting](https://twitter.com/ne0liberal). In broad strokes, they define neoliberalism as a strong belief in the power of free markets, with the recognition that there are still appropriate places for government intervention. You can check out the [top posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/top/?t=all) of their subreddit to get a general sense of the ideology.

Mike Gravel is an 89-year-old ex-senator from Alaska who is kinda-sorta running for president in the Democratic primary. I say "kinda-sorta" because rather than actually, I dunno, running a campaign or something, he just gave control of his twitter account to a couple of Gen-Z kids. Their goal is to move the Democratic primary's Overton window leftwards via—you guessed it—[viral tweeting](https://twitter.com/MikeGravel).

The Neoliberal project has a podcast (who doesn't...) and in one of their episodes they invited the Gravel teens on to discuss the campaign and it was maybe the most impressive thing I've listened to this year. Williams and Oks (the teens) demonstrate such a sophisticated understanding of politics, policy, and the power of clever tweeting that I chipped in a dollar to their campaign in the hopes that they can get Mike to qualify for the July debates.

## Longform article: ["The Day the Dinosaurs Died"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died)

If you're my age or older, when you were in elementary school you learned that we don't know exactly how the dinosaurs went extinct: like, it probably was a result of an asteroid collision, but maybe it was a bunch of volcano eruptions or something; expert opinions varied. In the years since, the consensus has firmly shifted in one direction: X million years ago, a giant asteroid hit the earth right by the Yucatan peninsula and almost all life on earth, including the dinosaurs, died over the course of the next 24 hours. There's a very clear demarcation in the fossil record called the KT boundary where you can visually see the result of the collision: below this layer you'll find dino bones and above you'll find none (and on the line itself you'll find unusual amounts of iridium, which sparkled down like snow from the asteroid as it burned up in the atmosphere).

There was one problem: for a long time we had never found any fossils buried in the foot or so just under the KT boundary. This gap lent credence to the idea that the dinosaurs went extinct *before* the asteroid hit.

## Shortform article: "Dumbest 'Gotcha' Story Of The Week: Google, Genius And The Copying Of Licensed Lyrics"

Genius accused Google of copying their lyrics in their search results, and this was mostly interesting to people because of the way they did it (encoding a message in morse code via curly vs. straight apostrophes), but actually this story is a lot weirder than that. It's a short article so just read it to find out why.

## Television: Season 7 of *Veep*
Just about every line of dialogue in *Veep* contains a joke. I binge-watched the first six episodes of the final season with my Dad yesterday and I couldn't stop laughing. It's fantastic, please watch it.

## Math puzzle: this thing I saw on twitter.com
<embedded tweet>
It's simple, but cute.

## Song: Cumbia remix of the *Avengers: Endgame* theme

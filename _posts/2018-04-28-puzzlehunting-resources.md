In the past four months I've had the experience of organizing a fledgling team for the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/) and helping organize, write, and run the [second iteration](https://2018.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/) of the Galactic Puzzle Hunt. In the process, I wrote / created a bunch of stuff related to puzzlehunting. This page will keep track of them all (as well as some earlier stuff I've made). I'll periodically update this page as I create more stuff.

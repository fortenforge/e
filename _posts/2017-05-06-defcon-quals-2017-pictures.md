Last weekend was DEF CON Quals 2017, the annual qualifier round to the DEF CON CTF held in Las Vegas every year. Last year I tried the CTF on my own and managed to solve 1 challenge. This year I participated on Lab RATs, a joint collaboration between MIT Lincoln Labs, RPISec, and TechSec.

My friend Ray [already recapped](https://wangray.github.io/2017/05/03/2017/DEF%20CON%20CTF%20Qualifier%202017/) most of what went down during the weekend on his blog, so I don't really feel the need to repeat any of it. Instead, let me tell the story of my past week entirely through pictures:
